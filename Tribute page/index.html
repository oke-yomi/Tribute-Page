      <h2 class="headline">The Life of Ida B. Wells</h2>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>1862:</strong> Ida Bell Wells, a first child in a family of eight children, was born in <b>July 16, 1862</b> and was not yet three years old when slavery was abolished and the Civil War ended, so she had no personal memories of being enslaved, thus most of her childhood was shaped by the Reconstruction Era.</li>
        <li><strong>1878:</strong> At the age of 16, Ida's family faced a terrible tragedy when she lost both her parents and her infant brother in the <b>1878 yellow fever epidemic</b>, leaving six Wells children orphaned and Ida assuming the role of the head in her family. <br> Despite all of this, she continued her studies, taught in Sunday school and also got a job as a school teacher. Three years later, Ida and her two youngest sisters, moved fifty miles away to Memphis, Tennessee, to live with their aunt, where Ida continued her work as a teacher.</li>
        <li><strong>1883:</strong> The Supreme Court had ruled against the <b>federal Civil Rights Act of 1875</b> (which had banned racial discrimination in public accommodations). The South was changing, Reconstruction was over. A new system called Jim Crow was slowly constricting black people's rights and freedom and enforcing segregation, mostly through violence and intimidation.</li>
        <li><strong>1884:</strong> When she was 22, Ida bought a first-class ticket on a train from Memphis to Holly Springs and took a seat in the ladies’ car, something she had done for the previous two years. This time, however, the conductor told her to move. Ida resisted, and when he tried to drag her from her seat, she bit his hand. Two men helped him forcibly remove her as white passengers applauded.
        After she was removed from the train, she sued the railroad for damages and won, but her triumph was short-lived, as the railroad won on appeal. Jim Crow was quickly becoming the law of the land.</li>
        <li><strong>1886:</strong> At the age 24, Ida lost her teaching job after she criticized conditions in the Memphis schools. She had written a few articles for newspapers and decided to turn to journalism full time. Three years later, she bought a share in the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight and was appointed its editor. She was the first female co-owner and editor of a black newspaper in the US. She began writing articles and editorials under the name “Iola.”</li>
        <li><strong>1892:</strong> Her friend Thomas Moss, a Memphis letter carrier and grocer, was lynched by a mob after confrontations with rival white grocers. Just before he was killed, Moss said to the mob: "Tell my people to go west, there is no justice here". After the lynching of her friend, Ida bought a pistol and wrote in <em>Free Speechand Headlight</em> urging African Americans to move out of Memphis for their safety. Then she began to focus her work on the rise in lynchings in America. The event led Wells to begin investigating lynchings using investigative journalist techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>1895:</strong> On June 27, 1895, in Chicago at Bethel AME Church, Wells married attorney Ferdinand L. Barnett, a widower with two sons, Ferdinand and Albert. A prominent attorney, Barnett was a civil rights activist and journalist in Chicago. Like Wells, he spoke widely against lynchings and for the civil rights of African Americans.</li>
        <li><strong>1908:</strong> Ida Wells, her husband, and some members of their Bible study group, founded the <b>Negro Fellowship League (NFL)</b>, the first Black settlement house in Chicago.The organization, in rented space, served as a reading room, library, activity center, and shelter for young Black men in the local community at a time when the local <b>Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA)</b> did not allow Black men as members. The NFL also assisted with job leads and entrepreneurial opportunities for new arrivals in Chicago from Southern States, notably those of the Great Migration. During her involvement, the NFL advocated for women's suffrage and supported the Republican Party in Illinois</li>
        <li><strong>1913:</strong> Ida marched in the suffrage parade in Washington, DC, when many of the organizers resisted black women’s participation in the parade. After black women were told they would march in segregated sections, the NAACP organized letter and telegram protests. The parade organizers relented and black suffragists, including Ida, marched in their state and occupational delegations.</li>
        <li><strong>1931:</strong> She continued her work for decades, traveling abroad to decry lynching and raise money and working with women’s clubs to encourage political participation, even running for state office herself until she died in <b>March 25, 1931</b>.</li>
